 ## App Exercise - Fitness Calculations
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 Your fitness tracker keeps track of users' heart rate, but you might also want to display their average heart rate over the last hour. Create three constants, `heartRate1`, `heartRate2`, and `heartRate3`. Give each constant a different value between 60 and 100. Create a constant `addedHR` equal to the sum of all three heart rates. Now create a constant called `averageHR` that equals `addedHR` divided by 3 to get the average. Print the result.
 */
let heartRate1 = 70
let heartRate2 = 80
let heartRate3 = 90
let addedHR = heartRate1 + heartRate2 + heartRate3
let averageHR = addedHR / 3
print (averageHR)
/*:
 Now create three more constants, `heartRate1D`, `heartRate2D`, and `heartRate3D`, equal to the same values as `heartRate1`, `heartRate2`, and `heartRate3`. These new constants should be of type `Double`. Create a constant `addedHRD` equal to the sum of all three heart rates. Create a constant called `averageHRD` that equals the `addedHRD` divided by 3 to get the average of your new heart rate constants. Print the result. Does this differ from your previous average? Why or why not?

let heartRate1D: Double = 70
let heartRate2D: Double = 80
let heartRate3D: Double = 90
